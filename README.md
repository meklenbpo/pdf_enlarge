# PDF enlarge

PDF-enlarge is a command-line utility program that will:
1. open a PDF document,
2. split every page in two parts, 
3. scale every part 2x and 
4. merge enlarged parts into a new PDF document.

This might be useful if the source PDF document font size is too small for
comfortable reading / printing.

# Usage

```shell
$ pdf-enlarge [source_pdf] [dest_pdf]
```
